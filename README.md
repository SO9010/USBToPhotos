<h1>Usb to Photos</h1>
<p>This is a simple python script made to automate transfering images from one drive to another. The default set up is for my Arch device.</p>

<h2>Goals</h2>
<p>In the future I'm wanting to addapt this script to react to new devices being pluged in and better duplicate file handeling.<br>I am also looking to have more efficient code as it currently is very inefficent due to the nested for loops.<br>I am looking to expand this project to be log the drive and have prefrences for each drive, e.g: if I only want to copy photos from a specific drive it will rember this and only copy them. </p>
