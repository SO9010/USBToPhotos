#Usb to Photos 
This is a simple python script made to automate transfering images from one drive to another. The default set up is for my Arch device. 

##Goals
In the future I'm wanting to addapt this script to react to new deviceses being pluged in and better duplicate file handeling.\n I am also looking to have more efficient code as it currently is very inefficent due to the nested for loops.\n I am looking to expand this project to be log the drive and have prefrences for each drive, e.g: if I only want to copy photos from a specific drive it will rember this and only copy them.
